# Spotify-End-End-Project-using-AWS

This project establishes a serverless data analytics workflow using AWS services to streamline data processing, querying, and visualization. The process begins with an IAM User or application uploading raw data to an Amazon S3 bucket (Staging). AWS Glue ETL processes this raw data, transforming and storing it in a Datawarehouse bucket. An AWS Glue Crawler scans the data, infers the schema, and updates the AWS Glue Data Catalog with metadata tables. AWS Athena utilizes this metadata to perform SQL queries on the data stored in the Datawarehouse. Finally, AWS QuickSight visualizes and analyzes the queried data, providing insightful dashboards and reports. This architecture ensures efficient data handling and analysis without the need for managing underlying infrastructure.
